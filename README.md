# LuaToC
Made by macsipac, a Lua to C transpiler
How to use:
1. If you did not already, install lua (luajit works best!)
2. Download the transpiler.lua file
3. Make a lua script. This will be turned into C
4. Run lua transpiler.lua [your .lua script name] (by default set to input.lua)
5. Output.c will be generated, if nothing went wrong it should be able to be compiled!
